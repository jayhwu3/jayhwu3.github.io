	<span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>You and Your Badge</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;">We are so happy that you are part of our family at Creating Change 2024! We ask you to visibly display your registration name badge when attending plenary sessions, workshops and caucuses and evening events;your badge is your “ticket.” Wearing your badge is a friendly thing to do because it makes it easier for folks to call you by name. As well, the wellbeing of all of us is a top priority: your name badge means you are part of our Creating Change family. Please wear your badge. Creating Change registrants without badges will be asked to retrieve them;or to purchase a new badge at Registration for an administrative fee of $5. Save yourself the inconvenience. Wear your badge. Thanks!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Protest Policy</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Political expression is an essential principle of democracy and in our LGBTQ+ movement for freedom, justice, and equality. We welcome debate and dialogue as key elements of the Creating Change Conference. While some participants may want to engage in nonviolent protest, the Task Force discourages the disruption of conference sessions, plenary sessions, meetings or exhibits that result in attendees not being able to fully participate in learning and educational opportunities available at Creating Change. We ask that this core principle of free exchange of ideas be respected as essential to the mission and spirit of the Creating Change Conference.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Please abide by these guidelines and this information:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Protests that occur on the plenary stage may not exceed 5 minutes.</strong> Anything longer than that is disrespectful to those we’ve invited as plenary speakers, whose voices are often the most marginalized and silenced in society.</span><br /><br /></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Protests within the hotel must be nonviolent “moving protests,” that is proceeding in a walking formation to avoid violations of Fire Code regulations regarding impeding the movements of others through the hotel and blocking doorways to meeting rooms.</span><br /><br /></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Hotels are not public spaces. The Hilton New Orleans Riverside can report any protest to local law enforcement at their discretion.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 18pt;">Violations of this policy may result in being asked to leave the Creating Change Conference in New Orleans, LA, and risks participation in future conferences.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The National LGBTQ Task Force reserves the right to determine whether a demonstration is disruptive and/or detrimental to the conference programs at Creating Change and to act accordingly. We seek to provide avenues for political expression while also balancing this with the needs of attendees, presenters, and exhibitors.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;">For those who may be organizing protests within the Hilton New Orleans Riverside during the Creating Change Conference, we ask you to inform Conference Director Danny Linden (<strong><a style="color: #5f259f;" href="mailto:dlinden@thetaskforce.org">dlinden@thetaskforce.org</a></strong>; <strong><a style="color: #5f259f;" href="tel:+12026396306">202-639-6306</a></strong>) and designate a contact person for your protest.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>No Guns at Creating Change!</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The National LGBTQ Task Force joins with the millions of people working to end gun violence. We ask, in the interest of everyone’s comfort and wellbeing, that no guns be brought into our conference spaces, sessions, and gatherings. We do not want guns or other deadly/dangerous weapons at Creating Change! If any attendee is observed carrying a gun while participating in the Creating Change Conference, you will be asked to remove it from the premises.</span>
